  # Create profiles table

  1. New Tables
    - `profiles`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key, references auth.users)
      - `business_name` (text)
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `profiles` table
    - Add policies for authenticated users to:
      - Read their own profile
      - Update their own profile
